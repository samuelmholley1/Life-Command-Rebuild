## üöÄ Production-Ready Next.js + Supabase Monorepo

**Deployment Status:**
- ‚úÖ Live on Vercel as of July 7, 2025
- ‚úÖ Yarn Berry monorepo, local packages, and all workspace dependencies are working
- ‚úÖ Vercel auto-detects Next.js app in `apps/web` (no `builds` in `vercel.json`)
- ‚úÖ Root build script: `yarn workspace @life-command/web run build`
- ‚úÖ No custom build/install commands in Vercel dashboard (unless troubleshooting)
- ‚úÖ `.next` excluded from type checking in `tsconfig.json` to avoid Next.js 15 PageProps type errors

**Vercel Project Settings (as of July 7, 2025):**
- Root Directory: monorepo root (not `apps/web`)
- Build Command: (blank, or `yarn workspace @life-command/web run build` if auto-detect fails)
- Output Directory: (blank, or `apps/web/.next` if needed)
- Install Command: (blank, or `yarn install --immutable` if needed)

**Key Lessons:**
- Do not use a `builds` section in `vercel.json` for monorepos‚Äîlet Vercel auto-detect Next.js
- Keep all workspace dependencies and local packages managed from the monorepo root
- If Vercel fails to detect, set the build command to `yarn workspace @life-command/web run build`
- Exclude `.next` from type checking in `tsconfig.json` to avoid generated type errors
