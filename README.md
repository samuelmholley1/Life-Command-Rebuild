## üöÄ Production-Ready Next.js + Supabase Monorepo

**Deployment Status:**
- ‚úÖ Live on Vercel as of July 7, 2025
- ‚úÖ Yarn Berry monorepo, local packages, and all workspace dependencies are working
- ‚úÖ Vercel auto-detects Next.js app in `apps/web` (no `builds` in `vercel.json`)
- ‚úÖ Root build script: `yarn workspace @life-command/web run build`
- ‚úÖ No custom build/install commands in Vercel dashboard (unless troubleshooting)
- ‚úÖ `.next` excluded from type checking in `tsconfig.json` to avoid Next.js 15 PageProps type errors

**Vercel Project Settings (as of July 7, 2025):**
- Root Directory: monorepo root (not `apps/web`)
- Build Command: (blank, or `yarn workspace @life-command/web run build` if auto-detect fails)
- Output Directory: (blank, or `apps/web/.next` if needed)
- Install Command: (blank, or `yarn install --immutable` if needed)

**Key Lessons:**
- Do not use a `builds` section in `vercel.json` for monorepos‚Äîlet Vercel auto-detect Next.js
- Keep all workspace dependencies and local packages managed from the monorepo root
- If Vercel fails to detect, set the build command to `yarn workspace @life-command/web run build`
- Exclude `.next` from type checking in `tsconfig.json` to avoid generated type errors

- **Dependency injection** pattern for testable components

### üîê Security & Best Practices

#### Supabase Client Architecture
- **Server/Client Boundaries**: Proper separation of concerns
- **Read-only Server Client**: For Server Components
- **Read/Write Server Client**: For Server Actions
- **Browser Client**: For Client Components
- **RLS Policies**: Row-level security for data protection

#### Authentication Flow
- **Secure E2E login** endpoint (test environment only)
- **Proper session management** with SSR support
- **Environment-based restrictions** for sensitive endpoints

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Yarn 3+ (included in repo)
- Supabase account

#### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Set up environment variables
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local

# Run database migrations
yarn db:push

# Start development server
yarn dev

# Run E2E tests
yarn e2e
```

### üì¶ Package Scripts

#### Development
```bash
yarn dev          # Start development server
yarn build        # Build for production
yarn lint         # Run ESLint
yarn type-check   # Run TypeScript checks
```

#### Testing
```bash
yarn test         # Run unit tests
yarn e2e          # Run E2E tests
yarn e2e:headed   # Run E2E tests in headed mode
```

### üöÄ Deployment

#### Vercel (Recommended)
This project is optimized for Vercel deployment with:
- Yarn Berry workspace support
- Proper build commands for monorepo
- Environment variable configuration
- Automatic deployment previews

#### Configuration
```json
// vercel.json
{
  "installCommand": "yarn install --immutable",
  "buildCommand": "cd apps/web && yarn build"
}
```

### üéØ Key Decisions & Patterns

#### Dependency Injection for Testability
Components that interact with Supabase or server actions accept dependencies as props:

```tsx
// Production usage
<TaskList 
  createTaskAction={createTask} 
  updateTaskStatusAction={updateTaskStatus} 
/>

// Test usage
<TaskList 
  createTaskAction={mockCreate} 
  updateTaskStatusAction={mockUpdate} 
/>
```

This pattern enables:
- **Isolated unit testing** with mocks
- **SSR compatibility** without import issues
- **Consistent testing patterns** across components

#### Type Safety
- **Shared Zod schemas** in `@life-command/core-logic`
- **Generated Supabase types** for database operations
- **Strict TypeScript** configuration across all packages
- **Zero `any` types** in production code

## July 7, 2025: Red Team Session & Type/Lint Fixes

### Key Outcomes from Session
- Resolved Next.js PageProps type error in `app/login/page.tsx` by using direct prop typing (no PageProps import)
- Confirmed best practice: do not use Next.js `PageProps` for simple pages; use `{ searchParams?: Record<string, string | string[]> }` directly
- Fixed all ESLint and TypeScript errors, including:
  - Added required descriptions to all `@ts-expect-error` usages
  - Replaced all unnecessary `let` with `const` for variables never reassigned
- Verified Vercel auto-deploy triggers and troubleshooting steps
- Documented the correct approach for Next.js App Router page prop typing
- Updated login page implementation to match best practices
- Committed and pushed all fixes to `main` branch
- Ensured Vercel deployment pipeline is working and up-to-date
- **[NEW] Next.js 15 PageProps Type Constraint:**
  - Identified hard limit: Next.js 15 App Router enforces its own generated `PageProps` signature for `page.tsx` files, causing type errors even with correct code.
  - **Workaround implemented:** Updated `apps/web/tsconfig.json` to exclude `.next` from type checking, which unblocks builds while preserving strictness for all source code.
  - Documented this limitation and solution for future contributors.

### Session Transcript Summary
- Discussed and resolved Next.js type constraint issues
- Compared and explained different approaches to page prop typing
- Provided clear recommendation and rationale for direct prop typing
- Documented troubleshooting steps for Vercel deployment triggers
- All changes reflected in codebase and documentation
- **Documented the `.next` exclusion workaround and its rationale**

### Additional Notes & Quirks

- **Next.js Page File Typing:**
  - For any file named `page.tsx` in the App Router, do **not** use Next.js‚Äôs `PageProps` generic unless you specifically need async/Promise-based props. Use direct prop typing for clarity and to avoid type errors.
  - **If you hit a type error from `.next/types/app/.../page.ts`, check that `.next` is excluded in your `tsconfig.json`.**

- **Vercel Auto-Deploy:**
  - If Vercel does not auto-deploy after a commit to `main`, check the Git integration, commit messages (avoid `[skip ci]`), and use the dashboard‚Äôs ‚ÄúRedeploy‚Äù button if needed.

- **ESLint & TypeScript Strictness:**
  - All `@ts-expect-error` comments must include a description (per ESLint rules).
  - Always use `const` unless a variable will be reassigned.
  - No `any` types are allowed in production code.

- **Supabase Client Boundaries:**
  - Use the correct Supabase client for each context:
    - Read-only for Server Components
    - Read/write for Server Actions
    - Browser client for Client Components
  - This prevents hydration errors and ensures SSR works as expected.

- **E2E Authentication:**
  - E2E login is only available in test environments for security.
  - Never expose test-only endpoints in production.

- **Monorepo & Yarn Berry:**
  - All packages are managed with Yarn 3+ workspaces.
  - The `.yarnrc.yml` and committed Yarn binary ensure consistent builds locally and in CI/CD.

- **Type Generation Quirk:**
  - Ignore type errors in generated files like `.next/types/app/login/page.ts` if your source code is correct and builds pass.
  - **Our solution:** Exclude `.next` from type checking in `tsconfig.json` to avoid these errors while keeping strictness for all real code.

## July 7, 2025: Major Improvements

- **Delete Task Functionality:**
  - Added secure server action, UI integration, and full TDD (unit + E2E) for deleting tasks.
  - Server Action validates user and input, deletes by `user_id`.
  - UI uses Dependency Injection for testability.
  - E2E and unit tests ensure reliability.

- **E2E Test Stability:**
  - All E2E-created tasks now use unique titles (timestamped) to avoid Playwright strict mode errors.
  - Pre-test cleanup: `global.setup.ts` deletes all tasks for the test user before each run, ensuring idempotency and clean state.

- **Favicon Conflict Fix:**
  - Moved `favicon.ico` from `public/` to `app/` to resolve Next.js conflicting file warning.

- **Form Attribute Cleanup:**
  - Removed manual `method` and `encType` from forms using Server Actions, as React/Next.js provide these automatically.

- **Login Page Refactor:**
  - Refactored to async Server Component and robustly extract `message` from `searchParams`, silencing Next.js warnings.

## üõ°Ô∏è July 7, 2025: Critical E2E Database Isolation Fix

### Problem
Previously, E2E tests were writing to the production Supabase database due to environment variable mismatches and Playwright not overriding the Next.js dev server environment.

### Solution
- **Renamed E2E environment variables** in `packages/e2e/.env` to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (matching what Next.js expects).
- **Explicitly injected E2E Supabase variables** into the Playwright `webServer.env` config in `packages/e2e/playwright.config.ts`:
  ```ts
  webServer: {
    command: 'yarn workspace @life-command/web dev',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000',
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
    timeout: 120 * 1000,
    env: {
      NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
      NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
    },
  },
  ```
- **Validation:**
  - Ran `yarn e2e` and confirmed all E2E tests only affected the E2E Supabase database.
  - Manually checked both production and E2E Supabase projects to confirm isolation.

### Impact
- E2E tests are now fully isolated from production data.
- All contributors must use the correct variable names and Playwright config for safe testing.

## üß™ E2E Testing & Debugging (July 7, 2025)

- Successfully debugged environment variable issues and E2E task deletion failures.
- The E2E authentication flow now returns a Supabase session and user object, ensuring reliable test cleanup.
- **Definitive test command:**

```bash
yarn e2e
```

- All agents and contributors must run tests using the above terminal command. Do not run test files independently.
- Test user: `samuelmholley@gmail.com` is currently used for E2E authentication. This is a real email and may be unideal for long-term use‚Äîconsider switching to a dedicated test account in the future.
