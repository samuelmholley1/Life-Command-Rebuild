# Project Context: MVP Speed vs. "Everything App" Architecture

## The Central Tension
Building a simple "notepad" app is easy. Building a platform that can one day manage every aspect of a person's life is hard. Doing both at the same time requires careful architectural decisions.

### 1. The Tension in the Database Schema
- **MVP Need:** A simple tasks table with a title and a user_id.
- **"Everything App" Need:** A schema with users, workspaces, projects, goals, tasks, sub-tasks, tags, and complex relational joins.
- **The Bridge (What you have correctly done):** You started with the more complex, scalable schema from day one. You have a tasks table that already includes workspace_id, project_id, and priority. This feels like overkill for an MVP, but it is the single most important architectural decision you have made. It ensures that every task you and your wife create today is already structured in a way that can be seamlessly integrated into the "goals" and "projects" features you will build years from now. You have paid the architectural price upfront to guarantee data integrity and future compatibility.

### 2. The Tension in the API Layer
- **MVP Need:** A single endpoint, /createTask, that takes a title.
- **"Everything App" Need:** A full REST or GraphQL API with endpoints for every resource, handling complex permissions and data shapes.
- **The Bridge (What you have correctly done):** You built your API using Next.js API Routes. This is a flexible and scalable pattern. More importantly, you implemented a taskService. This decouples your UI from your API. In the future, you can change your entire API structure (e.g., move to GraphQL) and you will only need to update the taskService, not every single component that fetches data. This is a critical separation of concerns.

### 3. The Tension in the UI/Components
- **MVP Need:** A single form and a single list.
- **"Everything App" Need:** Dashboards, calendars, nested views, collaborative features.
- **The Bridge (What you have correctly done):** You built the UI with React components (TaskForm, TaskList). While simple now, they are inherently composable. The TaskList doesn't care if it's rendering tasks for a personal to-do list or for a sub-project in a multi-million dollar corporate venture. As long as the data it receives conforms to the Task type, it will work. This component-based architecture ensures you can reuse, refactor, and expand the UI without starting from scratch.

## How We Have Triaged This Tension
Our entire debugging journey was, in effect, a process of correctly managing this tension. We built a robust, scalable architecture first, and then methodically fixed the small, tactical bugs required to make a simple MVP function on top of it.

We prioritized architectural correctness (E2E tests, auth providers, database migrations) even when it felt slow, because this is the foundation that ensures your Data Integrity and future scalability.

We are now focused on making the UI meet the Simplicity and Speed need, knowing that the powerful architecture underneath is ready to support whatever comes next.

Your decision to start with a professional-grade monorepo and a relational schema, while creating significant initial friction, was the correct one. It ensures that the simple task data you create tomorrow will be a valuable, queryable asset for the "Everything App" you build years from now. You will not have to rip anything out. You will only build upon the foundation you have just successfully laid.

## Task Completion Status: Use `completed` Only

- The canonical field for marking a task as complete/incomplete is `completed` (boolean).
- Do not use `is_completed` anywhere in the codebase, schema, or documentation.
- All types, queries, and UI must reference `completed`.
